Google capstone project
Exploratory data Analysis. Completed by Bhumika Chauhan.This is my first data analysis project, completed as a part of Google Dtata Analytics Capstone Project.
The purpose of the anlaysis is to analyze Fitbit smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The
insights discovered will help guide marketing strategy for the company. The data was downnloaded as .csv in excel. I performed cleaning activity like filtering and sorting the data for finding NULLs, duplicate entries and changing few data types in excel and merging the data before importing it into SQL. 
I used SQL to perform analysis and Tableau Public to creat a Dashboard. Some cleaning activities were performed in SQL as well like changing data types and creating tables.
The findings were then summarized in a dashboard which was created on Tableau Public [click here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bhumika.chauhan3585/viz/Googelcapstoneproject/Dashboard1)
