Google capstone project
Exploratory data Analysis. Completed by Bhumika Chauhan.This is my first data analysis project, completed as a part of Google Dtata Analytics Capstone Project.
The purpose of the anlaysis is to analyze Fitbit smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The
insights discovered will help guide marketing strategy for the company. The data was downnloaded as .csv in excel. I performed cleaning activity like filtering and sorting the data for finding NULLs, duplicate entries and changing few data types in excel and merging the data before importing it into SQL. 
I used SQL to perform analysis and Tableau Public to creat a Dashboard. Some cleaning activities were performed in SQL as well like changing data types and creating tables.
The findings were then summarized in a dashboard which was created on Tableau Public [click here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bhumika.chauhan3585/viz/Googelcapstoneproject/Dashboard1)

The findings are stated hereunder:-

1- The analysis tells an idividual burns upto an average of 2300 calories in a day but if we look at the calories/totalstep chart on our we will find that that merely taking more steps will not result in a healthy lifestyle. According to Government of Canada, an adult individual must remain active at least 2.5 hours a week to achieve health benefits, focus on moderate to vigorous aerobic activity throughout each week, broken into sessions of 10 minutes or more and add activities that target your muscles and bones at least two days per week i order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, Bellabeat should push notifications to their customers telling them to exercise and also stating heath benefits of being physical active.

2- The sedentary minutes/total steps charts shows the more time we sit the less we walk. The average sdentary time comes out to be 16 hours per day which is higher than the recommended sedenatry time of 8 hours or less(recommended by Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines). Bellabeat should push notification to their customer suggesting them to break longer period of sitting as often as possible also encourage people  to take no more than 3 hours of recreational screen time.
The average sleep time is 7 hours. Bellabeat should push notification to its customers encouraging them to have a sleep routine and also remind the customers time to time to stick the routine. It can also include in its marketing strategy how being physically active affect sleep quality and motivate it's customers to remain physically active.

3- The average number of steps taken by the users are 7637 whereas the recommende number of steps are 8000 according to CDC.According to the CDC research, taking 8,000 steps per day was associated with a 51% lower risk for all-cause mortality (or death from all causes). And taking 12,000 steps per day was associated with a
65% lower risk compared with taking 4,000 steps. Bellabeat shoul encourage it's customers to take atleast 8000 steps daily.
 
4- If we look at the intensity chart we can find that the customers are most active from 10 a.m to 8 p.m, Bellabeat can formulate marketing startegy keep in mind this data.

5- On analyzing the it was found out that there were 33 people tracking their physical activity out which 24 were tracking their sleep, 14 were tracking heart rate and only 8 were tarcking their weight. Bellbeat should encourage people track their weight and heart rate more often.

6- Bellabeat is a wellness company it should from time to time introduce new features like tracking blood pressure, tracking menstural cycles, tracking blood sugars spikes and others related ideas along with encourage people to make clean nutrituos diet by hosting healthy recipes on their application.

This was my analysis of the capstone project case study. Any recommendations and comments are appreciated.

Thankyou!
